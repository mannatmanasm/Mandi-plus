## What Changed

- **Invoice PDF Regeneration Endpoint**
  - Added `RegenerateInvoiceDto` (`invoiceId` + partial invoice fields) to allow updating an invoice and regenerating its PDF in a single call.
  - Added `POST /invoices/regenerate` controller endpoint that accepts a JSON body (no file upload required).
  - Implemented `InvoicesService.regenerateInvoiceAndPdf()` which reuses existing `update()` logic and queues the existing `invoice-pdf` BullMQ job.

## Why It Changed

- Needed a simple way for the client to send an `invoiceId` and updated invoice details in one payload.
- Required a dedicated API to trigger invoice data update and PDF regeneration without going through the multipart/form-data update flow.

## How It Affects the Current Code

- New DTO: `RegenerateInvoiceDto` in the invoices DTO folder.
- New endpoint: `POST /invoices/regenerate` (body includes `invoiceId` and any updatable invoice fields).
- Existing PDF generation flow is reused: after the invoice is updated, the `invoice-pdf` queue job regenerates the PDF and updates `pdfUrl` on the invoice.

## Developer Notes

- To use the new flow, send a JSON payload like:

  ```json
  {
    "invoiceId": "uuid-of-invoice",
    "supplierName": "Updated Supplier",
    "billToName": "Updated Buyer",
    "amount": 12345.67
  }
  ```

- The service will:
  - Load and update the invoice with the provided fields.
  - Queue a new `generate-pdf` job for that invoice.
  - Save the updated `pdfUrl` when the job completes (same behavior as existing create/update flows).
